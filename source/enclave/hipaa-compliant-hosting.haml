          HIPAA defines requirements for companies that create, receive, maintain,
          or transmit electronic protected health information (ePHI, or PHI).

        %p
          The HIPAA Security Rule states that companies must implement “reasonable
          and appropriate safeguards” over PHI, but identifying and implementing
          can be overwhelming when launching a new product or entering a new market.

        %p
          Aptible Enclave® is a HIPAA-compliant hosting platform that protects
          your customers’ PHI with industry-standard safeguards. Enclave helps you
          quickly and easily satisfy HIPAA requirements, and succeed in audits and
          vendor assessments.

            As soon as your app is ready, upgrade to a production plan. For
            HIPAA hosting, we’ll sign a Business-Associate Agreement (BAA)
            together. Signing a BAA with us is a legal requirement required for
            hosting PHI on Enclave.

        Physical Safeguards
      %h3.subtitle.subtitle--with-hr
        HIPAA requires you to concern yourself with Physical Safeguards to
        protect the systems hosting your PHI from natural and environmental
        hazards or unauthorized intrusion.
      %p
        When deploying in a cloud environment, most of these is handled by
        your provider, but it’s still your responsibility to ensure business
        continuity in the event of e.g. a disaster compromising the data
        center(s) you’re deployed in.
      %p
        Enclave is built on AWS, so we inherit their safeguards in terms of
        intrusion prevention, and so do you. But, Enclave also ensures your
        database backups are distributed across multiple geographical regions,
        so your business can survive even major disasters.

    .grid-item
      %h2.title
        Administrative Safeguards
      %h3.subtitle.subtitle--with-hr
        HIPAA requires you to implement a security management program.
        Among other things, you must prepare contingency and incident response
        plans, train your workforce, and periodically assess your performance.
      %p
        Aptible Enclave makes it easier to implement a security management
        program by taking responsibility for many of your organization’s
        requirements, thus minimizing the scope of your security management
        program.
      %p
        That said, Enclave does not help you think through your security
        management program, if you’d like a self-service platform for managing
        this administrative aspect of compliance, consider Aptible Gridiron,
        which integrates with Aptible Enclave.

        Beyond HIPAA: Vendor Assessments

        Meeting HIPAA requirements is only the baseline you must comply with
        when deploying applications processing PHI.
      %h3.subtitle.light-blue-gray
        However, potential partners and customers such as hospitals and
        insurance networks will often impose much more stringent and specific
        requirements upon you as part of their vendor assessments.
