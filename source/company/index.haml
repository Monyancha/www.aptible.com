        %p
          Building trust is essential to unleashing the internet’s transformative potential: A global internet based on strong trust can build communities, reshape economies, and improve the lives of billions around the world.
        %p
          We are starting with data security and privacy: The world is growing more aware that data, such as personal data, has become powerful, sensitive, and risky to handle. We believe the best way to build trust is to build teams that are inherently trustworthy.

      %h2.title How We Prioritize
      %h3.subtitle
        Every decision has an opportunity cost. We don’t always have to choose between these things, but if push comes to shove, here’s how we think:

          %h2 Customer empowerment over customer happiness
          %p We think of customer success in terms of empowerment and growth through self-improvement, which makes it easy to have a deep passion for that success and be deeply invested in it. We want to see our customers grow into mature teams that excel at protecting data. That said, the customer is not always right. Sometimes we tell customers things they don’t want to hear, to help them improve. We think and talk about empowerment across the entire team, not just product: In our marketing, we’re more likely to give away knowledge than swag. In sales, we always try to answer substantive questions and provide a roadmap for prospects, even if they don’t buy.

        .third
          %h2 Experience and opinion over flexibility
          %p Empowerment and growth as self-improvement also deeply inform our design for customer experiences, like product and support. We help our customers by solving hard problems in multiple domains. Our customers look to us as guides, and we weave our deep legal and technical experience into our software and services. Our products teach you how to get better as you use them: to do this well, we often choose to sacrifice flexibility first. 

        .third
          %h2 Leverage over effort
          %p Our customers value leverage: doing more with less time and money, and fewer people. Our products give them leverage by making complex processes simple and safe. With Gridiron, our customers can launch an enterprise-grade compliance program without a CISO or security department. With Enclave, our customers get the benefits of a secure, highly-available, fault-tolerant infrastructure without having to recruit, run, and retain a DevOps team. We build products and experiences that give customers more value as they invest more into them.
          %p As a team, we praise focus and seek leverage as we plan our work. Individually, we plan our work to make the biggest impact with the least amount of precious time. Sleep is leverage: We believe in getting enough of it. Good health is leverage: We take pride in our physical and mental health benefits. It will take years to reach our most ambitious goals, so we aim to perform at a high level over a long period of time.

          %h2 Commitment to the Team
          %p We are building an exceptional team by finding exceptional people that care deeply about building exceptional teams, wherever they are. We talk a lot about the science of high-performing teams and how to make Aptible the best environment to build that kind of team. We reward people who contribute ideas and effort to team building. You'd probably fit in if you have a track record of being a member of high-performing teams before (in work, sports, music, really anything) and love the mutual support and camaraderie of a strong team that wins together.  

        .third
          %h2 Commitment to Each Other
          %p We commit to each other as individuals, one on one. We measure our commitments carefully and hold each other accountable, which means we’re able to deliver more for our colleagues and customers in the long run. We set only a few very clear, ambitious goals as a company each quarter, and talk about them constantly to reinforce focus. We make time to recognize, praise, and reward those who consistently deliver on their promises.

        .third
          %h2 Commitment to the Mission
          %p Startups are hard, and we expect challenges and missteps. We love winning, but most of all, we value getting back up and getting better at what we do. We are deeply motivated to build trust on the internet by empowering teams, and we respect grit and perseverance in furtherance of that mission.
      .row{ style: 'margin-top: -50px' }
        .third
          %h2 Growth Over Perfection
          %p We fail often and early, and learn from it. We talk about improving constantly. We praise those who give feedback early and often. We put effort into being good at giving feedback: When we give feedback, we make each other feel big, not small. This helps create an environment where we can take reasonable risks, which in turn helps us make decisions quickly and learn fast. We expect managers to delegate a lot, and acknowledge that delegation means sometimes letting someone make what you think is the wrong decision.

        .third
          %h2 Teaching as Learning
          %p We are a team of learners. We value and respect teaching - we believe it’s the best way to learn, and make time to share information openly. We set explicit goals around training, and devote resources to developing and improving our internal training. We praise those who share knowledge in public, such as asking and answering questions in team chat, writing documentation, and writing for our customers.


        .third
          %h2 Taking Responsibility Over Giving Responsibility
          %p Identifying problems is a good start, but we love solving them more. We think and talk a lot about how we can improve, and work hard at it. We value and reward those who take initiative. We don't like meetings where we only talk about problems.

          %h2 Asking Why
          %p We ask “why?” a lot in order to understand root causes. Asking why helps us cultivate focus and make high-quality decisions quickly. We don't attributes mistakes to human error - we view it as a starting point for an inquiry, not the end.
