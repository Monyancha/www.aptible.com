          We believe building trust is essential to unleashing the internet’s transformative potential: A global internet based on strong trust can build communities, reshape economies, and improve the lives of billions around the world.
        %p
          We are starting with security and privacy. Data, such as personal data, is increasingly sensitive and risky to handle.

      %h2.title What We Prioritize
      %h3.subtitle
        Every decision has an opportunity cost. We don’t always have to choose between these things, but if push comes to shove, here’s how we think:

        .third
          %h2 Customer empowerment over customer happiness
          %p We think of customer success in terms of empowerment and growth through self-improvement, which makes it easy to have a deep passion and investment in that success. We want to see our customers grow into mature teams that are excellent at protecting data. This is true across Aptible, not just product and support: In our marketing, we’re more likely to give away knowledge than swag. In sales, we always try to answer substantive questions and provide a roadmap for prospects, even if they don’t buy. 

        .third
          %h2 Experience and opinion over flexibility
          %p Empowerment and growth as self-improvement also deeply inform how we approach product design and support. We differentiate on legal and technical experience, and bake this knowledge into our products. Aptible is not a black box. Customers use us to offload challenging problems, but they also constantly learn how to better approach these problems as a result of using our software and services. 

        .third
          %h2 Leverage over effort
          %p As a company, we aim for breadth, impact on a large scale. We want to help thousands of teams, which demands accessibility and simplification without sacrificing impact. With Gridiron, you can launch an enterprise-grade compliance program without a CISO or formal compliance experience. With Enclave, you get the benefits of highly-available, fault-tolerant infrastructure without a DevOps team. For every ounce of effort our customers put into Aptible, we give them pounds of value back, for as long as our relationship lasts.

          %h2 Growth Over Perfection
          %p We help each other improve. When we give feedback, we make each other feel big, not small. This helps us take reasonable risks, which helps us make decisions and learn quickly. We fail often and early, and learn from it.

        .third
          %h2 Teaching as Learning
          %p We believe that teaching is the best way to learn, and make time to share information openly.

        .third
          %h2 Constructiveness Over Commiseration
          %p We seek to improve through self-reflection and hard work. We prefer to offer solutions to problems.
